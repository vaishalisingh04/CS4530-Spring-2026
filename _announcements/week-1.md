On behalf of the entire [instructional team](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2026/staff) (all 3 instructors and 18 TAs), welcome to the Spring 2026 edition of CS 4530! [This website](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2026/) will contain all of the lectures, assignments and tutorials for the class. Our [Canvas site](https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/239553) contains your gradebook as well as single-sign-on links to Piazza (for questions and discussion), instructions for submitting assignments and replicates much of the material from the class website.

In advance of the first week of class, we've shared the [calendars for each section](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2026/calendar/), the first two lectures (with related activities), and tutorials on installing your IDE, Typescript, Unit testing with Vitest, and API Requests. 

The first [individual project deliverable](https://neu-se.github.io/CS4530-Spring-2026/assignments/ip1) will also be posted shortly. This deliverable will be due on Wednesday January 21st 11am EST. Your work will be submitted through github Classroom and Gradescope.  

Tomorrow afternoon (i.e., first day of classes), we will be adding all enrolled students to our github organization (and you will be receving an invitation by email). Once you have accepted that, you will be be able to start working on IP1, which we would encourage you to do early. Feel free to use piazza to ask questions and use office hours if you need help. 

The schedule of office hours will be posted on the staff page tomorrow. We will start holding office hours from Thursday Jan 8th and we will have 70+ hours of scheduled TA office hours per week. 

Zoom link for the online section (Section 4) can be found on Canvas -> Zoom Meetings.

We are looking forward to meeting you all this week!
